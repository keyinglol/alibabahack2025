=============================================================================

Running a restaurant is a high-stakes game. One day you're tossing out spoiled ingredients from overstocking, the next you're scrambling because you ran out of chicken mid-rush. Food waste is a global problem, [1/3 of all food produced is lost or wasted –around 1.3 billion tonnes of food –costing the global economy close to $940 billion each year.](http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/en). It hits F&B businesses hard. Enter our intelligent inventory management system, powered by Alibaba Cloud, designed to tackle these headaches with smart predictions, real-time insights, and a unique business model to make it accessible.
